# **I’ve got that on vinyl!** 

## Description:

Connect Four is a two player, turned based game, played on a gird that stands up vertically. Each player takes a turn claiming spaces on the grid. The first player to get four chips in a line wins. This can be done vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## Objective:

A social media app focused on collecting and sharing opinions on records. Utilizing the Discogs API, the app has an extensive data source to work from.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Motivation:

Collecting and listening to records is typically a more focused activity than just streaming music. If you are going to go through the trouble of buying, and playing a record, it is typically because that album is somehow special to you. I’m always happy to share music that is important to me. Building an application around that was an obvious choice for this project.

## Minimum Viable Product:

1. A site that can be logged into using Google Oauth
   
2. Access to content and features once the user is logged in
   
3. The ability to search an API for records
   
4. The ability to add specific records to my collection
   
5. All records in my collection will appear in my profile
   
6. The ability to leave opinions on records in my collection
   
7. The ability to delete opinions I’ve previously left

## Technology Used:

* JavaScript
* ejs
* dotenv
* CSS
* HTML
* Git
* Express
* Google Oauth 2.0
* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* Axios
* method override

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Stretch Goals:

* The user should be able to see what other users have collections
* The user should be able to follow those users
* The user should be able to unfollow users
* The user should be able to remove albums from their collection

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Hindsight Perspective:

Moving forward, I think it would benefit me to take notes keeping track of my variable, and values as they are passed through the application. Far too often I would get lost, and not know how to reference variables correctly.
